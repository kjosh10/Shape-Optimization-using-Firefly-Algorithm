# Shape optimization using Firefly Algorithm

The project focuses on optimizing the shape of the structure of the girder bridge combining the concepts of Finite Element Method (FEM) and optimization approaches.

## Aim of the project
The main aim of the project is to optimize the shape of the girder bridge using Bezier Curves and Finite Element approaches.

This project has few subsections which can simply be desccribed as below:-


### FEM side
The structure of the girder bridge has been descritized by using tri-angular CST (Constant Strain Triangle) elements.

### Shape change
The shape change of the girder structure is done using Bezier Curves using both Quadratic/Cubic curves.

### Optimization 
The shape optimization of the structure is done using Firefly algorithm generating random population of shapes of the structure.
